      <p>
        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a keen eye for creating
        elegant, efficient solutions. My journey in software development began
        with a curiosity for how things work and evolved into a career of
        building impactful digital experiences. I specialize in modern web
        technologies, from crafting pixel-perfect user interfaces to
        architecting scalable backend systems. I believe in writing clean,
        maintainable code and staying current with industry best practices. When
        I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing
        to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer
        community.
